{"name":"Piespoon","tagline":"Apps for everyone","body":"### Welcome to Piespoon\r\n\r\nWe've just finished our first app, **Wormy Drawing**, which you can download for free from the App Store. It's a fun drawing app built especially for young kids. It was designed, developed and written by an 8 year-old who wanted something that would be easy to use for people who can't read. He tested it on his younger sister, who loves it!\r\n\r\n### Privacy statement\r\n\r\nOur apps do not collect data about their users, and do not communicate information back to us in any way. They just let you draw pictures on the screen using your fingers.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nPlease contact smkirby@gmail.com with any problems, and check out what else I do [here](http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~simon).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
