{"name":"Piespoon","tagline":"Apps for everyone","body":"### Welcome to Piespoon\r\n\r\nWe are a father and son team who make fun apps. Here's what our founder (aged 8) has to say about his debut app:\r\n\r\n> **I've just made an app for children. Kids under 5 will probably enjoy it most, but anyone can use it to draw cool pictures. It started as a mistake when I was trying out Scenes in Python but ended up as a drawing app my little sister enjoyed, so i decided to release it for every one. I designed it so that people who can't read can use it.**\r\n\r\n### Privacy statement\r\n\r\nOur apps do not collect data about their users, and do not communicate information back to us in any way. They just let you draw pictures on the screen using your fingers.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nPlease contact smkirby@gmail.com with any problems, and check out what else I do [here](http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~simon).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
