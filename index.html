<p>We are a father and son team who make fun apps. Here's what our founder (aged 8) had to say about his debut app, <em>Wormy Drawing</em> back in 2014:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>I've just made an app for children. Kids under 5 will probably enjoy it most, but anyone can use it to draw cool pictures. It started as a mistake when I was trying out Scenes in Python but ended up as a drawing app my little sister enjoyed, so i decided to release it for every one. I designed it so that people who can't read can use it.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Wormy Drawing</em> is available for <strong>free</strong>. The first two versions were developed almost entirely on the iPad using the <a href="http://omz-software.com/pythonista/">Pythonista</a> app.
	      For version 3, we ported the app to Swift.</p>

<p>Our apps do not collect data about their users, and do not communicate information back to us in any way. They just let you draw pictures on the screen using your fingers.</p>
